# Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting

we have complete the reproduction of the thesis, data can be added in 'data/we/'; use the train.py to training you model, and use demo.py to recover the weights saved in the fold of 'weights'!!!

This is a TensorFlow implementation of Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network in the following paper: \
Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, Yan Liu, [Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01926), ICLR 2018.
