# Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting

We have complete the reproduction of the thesis, data can be added in 'data/we/'; use the dcrnn_train.py to training you model, and use run_demo.py to recover the weights saved in the fold of 'data/weights/'!

This is a TensorFlow implementation of Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network in the following paper: \
